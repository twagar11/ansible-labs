# Overview

In this lab, You will learn how to confirm the connection between your control center and hosts.

Basically, We are going to use a module called `ping` 


## Duration

25 minutes


## Step 1 - Requirements

In our labs, are hosts are using password for authentication. 

Ansible needs another application called `sshpass` to connect to host.

Run the following command only on your control center

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y sshpass
```

To confirm that `sshpass` is installed use the following command:

```bash
$ sshpass -V
```
Output will look like:

```console
sshpass 1.06

Using "assword" as the default password prompt indicator.
```


## Step 2 ‚Äî getting to know the Module `ping`

`ping` module is used to verify connectivity between the control center and hosts.

default template looks like:

```bash
$ ansible <Host-Group> -m ping
```

## Step 3 - Running a sample

Run the following command to see the results

```bash
$ ansible webserver -m ping
```

output

```console
<IP 1> | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
<IP 1> | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

```

Note the following part
```console
    SUCCESS
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
```

This means
- C&C can connect to the hosts
- nothing is changed on the hosts


## Well done! üëè
